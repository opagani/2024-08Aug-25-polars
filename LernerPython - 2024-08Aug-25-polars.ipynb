The bad news is that you have to install / choose which data-frame package you want to use in Python. The good news is that we have a few great options to choose from.\n",

    "Pandas is the 900-pound gorilla in this space.  Polars is a relatively new entry, and it's written for (a) speed of execution, (b) builtin multithreading, (c) lazy loading of data, and (d) a very minimalist, elegant API.\n",
